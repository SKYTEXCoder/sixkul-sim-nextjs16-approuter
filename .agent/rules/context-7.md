Always use context7 every single little time when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API (Application Programming Interface) documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools/Servers to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask for it.
